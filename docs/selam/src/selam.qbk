Selam is a c++ audio encoder and decoder library of the sela audio codec format.

Selam forks from c++ sela audio codec project.

Selam c++ project code breaks the clone-link with sela c++ project, because selam changes the file structures, code structures and code styles very much.

The audio codec structure and file extension name of format .sela are kept the same.

Sela is a lossless audio codec which aims to be as simple as possible while still having good enough compression ratios.
